Description: Fast streaming JSON parser for Java
 Noggit is the world's fastest streaming JSON parser for Java.
 Features:
  * Fast! Measured as the fastest JSON parser on char[], String input.
  * Streaming API (StAX/pull-parser like) for both easy and efficient parsing
  * Conforms to the JSON standard: http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt
  * Memory efficiency
     * incremental parsing (Reader-based) in order to handle huge messages
     * a single byte of state needed per nested object or array
     * does not read large objects (including primitives) completely
       into memory unless asked
     * can eliminate most copying, allowing the user to provide
       the output buffer for values
  * can handle primitives of any size (does not attempt to parse
    numerics into a certain language primitives unless asked)
  * Simple serialization of objects (List, Map, etc)
  * Optional creation of objects (List, Map, etc) when parsing.
